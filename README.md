## **Description**

_This program will allow a user to input their location and receive information on businesses that are currently open during the COVID-19 pandemic. It will also tell the user what safety tips they should follow while going out in public. Once the quarantine has been lifted we'd like to update it with businesses that have closed due to the pandemic._
